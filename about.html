            I always enjoyed math and problem solving but I never considered software engineering as a possible career path because female programers were extremly rare and often frowned upon when I was a college student. During my graduate studies I got an opportunity to work on a climate change research but sadly I had to decline because good coding skills were one of the prerequisites. Probably around that time I got deterimed to learn coding.

            After a brief career in air pollution research and environmental testing I relocated to the USA to the San Francisco Bay Area and when I got an opportunity to study part-time at the local community college, my choice was clear; I signed up for a Java programming class. I had an excellent female professor who refuted all my prejudice about female programmers and most importantly thanks to her I discovered my passion about coding.

            In the past two years I took several computer science classes at the College of San Mateo as well as completed Java programming certificate. Recently I decided to take the plunge and enroll in an intensive 16 weeks long programming bootcamp at the Rithm School in San Francisco. I plan to graduate this June and I hope to find my first job as software developer this summer.
